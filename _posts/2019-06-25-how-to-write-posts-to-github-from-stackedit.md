title: How You Can Write Blog Posts from StackEdit to GitHub Jekyll blog
---

Do you know that you can write stuff to [GitHub](https://github.com) from [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io)?

Once you do all required steps you'll have interface like this:

In order to do so you should:
1. grant access to your GitHub repo from StackEdit (after that you'll be able to load .md files from GitHub and upload them there
2. so after point 1 you are ready to work on your new blog post :)
3. Once new post is ready to be uploaded to GitHub, just click `Save on GitHub`
4. Provide required details (for me posts are in the `_posts/` folder of the repo)
5. If you want to update already uploaded file just click `Synchronize now` and that's it

That's it - have a happy blogging time.

PS: I'm not sure that extra features of StackEdit will work with .md files - haven't tried it yet. Anyway StackEdit have an option to process markdown itself and upload .html files (so if I'll need it - I'll try exporting to html and uploading already processed post).
