Hi! My name is Andrey Dresvyannikov (aka sepulchered).
Here is the things I'm currently doing:

1. Team lead at [Mindojo](https://mindojo.com) - awesome educational platform.
2. Synth exploration (modular synths, programming synths, etc.) and music programming with ChucK.
3. Learn Haskell programming language.
4. Learn stuff on machine learning and data analysis.
5. Learn stuff on linguistics.

I don't provide professional services on any of the above (except for 1. where I have format contract), 
but if you want to chat about anything related to the abovementioned topics - feel free to contact me (really).
